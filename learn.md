- Why Astronauts need to have super sharp reactions in Space and the average distance travelled by the ISS.  
- How to import images into Scratch and use them as backgrounds and sprites.
- How to store data like time and distance in variables.
- Use mutiplying operators to calculate distance travelled of the ISS.
