In this activity, you will learn about Astronaut reaction times, and distances travelled by the International Space Station in that time, by creating a reaction time game in Scratch.

For the first time ever, a British astronaut from the European Space Agency is going to live and work on the International Space Station. British ESA Astronaut Tim Peake is going to orbit the earth for half a year. But what is it like to live and work in space? 

You can learn more about what it is like to be an astronaut and more about Tim Peake's mission on [the UK National STEM Centre website here](http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/timpeake).
